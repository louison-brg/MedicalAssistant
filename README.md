# 🧠 MedLLM iOS

### Local Medical Language Model for iPhone & iPad

---

## 📋 Overview

**MedLLM iOS** is an experimental project that aims to build a **medical language model (LLM)** capable of running **entirely offline** on iPhone and iPad devices.

The goal is to combine:
- 🤖 **Deep learning & NLP** (PyTorch)  
- 📱 **On-device inference** (CoreML)  
- ⚙️ **MLOps tools** (MLflow, GitHub Actions, Docker)

---

## 🧩 Project Goals

- Build and fine-tune a **custom medical LLM** (based on MedQA, MedDialog, etc.)  
- Optimize the model for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M4)**  
- Deploy it locally via **CoreML** in a native **SwiftUI app**  
- Implement lightweight **CI/CD & experiment tracking**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python / PyTorch / Hugging Face**  
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking  
- **CoreML & SwiftUI** for iOS deployment  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
